		<p>For the last year I’ve worked at <a href="https://mural.co/" target="blank">MURAL</a>, whose mission is to enable creative people around the world to be more productive and collaborative. MURAL believes that diverse teams lead to better outcomes, and the widest diversity is usually beyond one physical location. MURAL also believes that a creative process that is inclusive and visual makes teams more successful.
</p>

		<p>Those values make up the core philosophy behind the product: online, collaborative whiteboards called murals that people use to brainstorm, facilitate workshops with remote participants, build diagrams collaboratively and much more. In 2017, users created ~300K murals and each week more than 20K people from across the globe used our product.</p>
			
			
		<p>My role as a product designer was to work with PMs, engineering, customer success and sales to identify problems and opportunities in people’s experience using MURAL and design solutions for them.</p>

		<p>Learn more about the work I did at MURAL:</p>
