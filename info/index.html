		<p>I’m Aiden. I grew up in the Bay Area. When I was 16 I participated in a homestay and youth leadership program in Nicaragua. It was a turning point for my life because it showed me that I learn faster when I’m in an unfamiliar environment. Two years later, I became a project supervisor for the same program in Peru, where I realized my obsession for working on tough problems with a collaborative, diverse and transparent team.</p>

		<p>In college I worked summers at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/">IBM Design</a> in Austin and <a href="http://www.startupchile.org/">Start-Up Chile</a> in Santiago. I graduated with a BFA in Communication Design from <a href="https://wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a>.</p>
			
		<p>After college I moved back to Chile and designed independently for a few startups. At the beginning of 2017 I moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina to work at a software startup called  <a href="https://mural.co/" target="blank">MURAL</a>, where I spent a year learning from some of the smartest people I’ve worked with.</p>

		<p>My biggest motivator is learning and my biggest fear is complacency. Currently I am traveling between Latin America and California and looking for my next big project. If you’ve read this far and have something interesting you’re working on, I’d love to hear from you.</p>
